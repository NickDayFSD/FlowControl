## Making a plan
1) Make a drawing of your app. Simple "wireframes"
2) Once you have a drawing, name the HTML elements you'll need to realize your vision
3) For each HTML element ask: Why do I need this?
    - This is your pseudocode
4) Once we know _why_ we need each element, think about how to implement the "Why" as a "How"
5) Find all the 'events' (user clicks, form submit, etc) in your app. Ask one by one, "What happens when" for each of these events.
6) Think about how to validate each of your steps

# Plan

## HTML
Add a photo and remove animation
Add a title
Create 3 sections with headers to label them
Use an unordered list and an ordered list
 - list of hobbies (unordered)
 - list of places lived (ordered)
Add a quiz button covering topics above

## JavaScript
What: button to start the quiz
How: 

## CSS

Create a test
validate yes/no answers
since I don't know how to test, try making the function first
